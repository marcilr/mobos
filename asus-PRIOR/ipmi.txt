Intelligent Platform Management Interface
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of computer interface
specifications for an autonomous computer subsystem that provides management and monitoring
capabilities independently of the host system's CPU, firmware (BIOS or UEFI) and operating
system.  IPMI defines a set of interfaces used by system administrators for out-of-band
management of computer systems and monitoring of their operation.  For example, IPMI provides
a way to manage a computer that may be powered off or otherwise unresponsive by using a network
connection to the hardware rather than to an operating system or login shell.

The specification is led by Intel and was first published on September 16, 1998.  It is supported
by more than 200 computer system vendors, such as Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, NEC
Corporation, SuperMicro and Tyan.[1]
