ECC (Error Correction Code)


What is the difference between non ECC and ECC memory?
======================================================
Difference between ECC and Non- ECC Memory. ECC stands for "error correcting code."
Like parity memory, ECC memory detects and reports memory errors.  However, while
parity can only detect errors, ECC can actually correct errors without interrupting
the other operations of your system.

What is ECC registered?
=======================
Registered (often referred to as "buffered") memory uses a technology that is often
paired with, but not directly related to, ECC RAM.  Registered memory has a "register"
that resides between the RAM and the system's memory controller which lessens the load
that is placed on the memory controller itself.Nov 5, 2013
